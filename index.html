<!-- Main content -->
<p>Innovations in technology have changed the way limb prostheses are created, improving their effectiveness, comfort, and quality of life for those who are missing or have damaged limbs. 
  Advances like this support limb prosthesesâ€™ ability to restore movement, offer intuitive control and lessen social stigma. 
  Technology integration has produced comfortable, lightweight prostheses that nearly mimic real limbs. 
  Tissue-engineered prostheses, adaptive control systems, and direct brain-to-limb connections are all products of exciting research areas including regenerative medicine, AI algorithms, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). 
  These advancements boost accessibility and cost while also enabling people to reclaim their freedom and sense of completeness</p>

<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
